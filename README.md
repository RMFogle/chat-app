# chat-app 

## Demo: 
Here is a working live demo: 

## Motivation 
- I wanted to learn the basics on how to build a chat app and came across npm package react-chat-engine. After reading the documentation and doing some research I was able to build my first chat app. 

## Build with: 
- React 
- Axios 
- React-Chat-Engine 
- Chatengine.io for serverless backend. 
- Netlify for deployment.

## Features: 
- Realtime chat.
- Multiple users per chat. 
- Admin can add or remove users from chat.
- Admin can create chats.
- All users can send messages and upload/share images. 

## Bugs: 
- Data lags or doesn't update when switching between chat boards. This occurs inconsistantly.

## Roadmap: 
- Hide projectID in .env file. Change string to process.env.
- Add JWT Login with Firebase. 
- Add social authentication, Google Login and Facebook Login. 
- Allow all users to edit their own messages. 
- Allow all users to delete their own messages. 
- Allow Admin to edit/delete messages from all users.
